## Prerequisites
 * You should be very familiar with JavaScript and have a good understanding of HTTP. Experience with HTML and CSS is a plus, but not required to get the most from the material.
 * You should have access to a running instance of Node and be able to save your exercises and run them locally.
 * Starter Templates and Examples will be shared through Github. You will need to have a github account (or have access to one) to pull the project templates and have basic experience with Git.
 
## Preparation
Attendees will spend most of the day writing code. You should have a comfortable place to work with a working computer loaded with your favorite developer tools.

All code examples will be in “plain Javascript” and will not depend on any libraries or frameworks. Attendees are encouraged to build the assignments without reliance to external libraries/frameworks but you are free to use whatever helps you get the most out of the sessions.

Some background material and starter files will be posted to the Github repo a week before the tutorial starts. Attendees are free to pull the files and review them in preparation for the tutorial day. Throughout the day, portions of the trainer’s code will be posted to Heroku for validation and testing. The ability to access the internet and run those examples will enhance your tutorial experience.
